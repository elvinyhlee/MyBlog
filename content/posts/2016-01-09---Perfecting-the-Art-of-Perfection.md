### **Study Plan**

For the **first 2 weeks**, the focus is on getting yourself familiar with different AWS services. Learn the theory by taking online course. Create an AWS account and start exploring the products with [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

To better understand the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/), I recommend taking the free [Exam Readiness course](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=20685) offered by [AWS Digital and Classroom Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/). Remember to try out the [Sample Questions](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS_Certified_Solutions_Architect_Associate_Sample_Questions.pdf) as soon as possible to get a taste of the AWS exam.

For the **next 2 weeks**, try taking practice exams and revisiting the topics that you are not familiar with. Doing practice exams is really important as you must adapt yourself to different types of question. There are lots of tricky questions, donâ€™t worry if you get less than 70% in the beginning. You are ready to go once you consistently get higher than 80%.

Side note: how I allocated my time:

* weekday: ~2.5 hrs/day
* weekend: ~4 hrs/day
